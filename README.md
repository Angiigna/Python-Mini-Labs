# 🐍 Python Mini Labs – My Learning Journey

Welcome! This repository is a personal catalog of mini Python programs that document my learning process as I study Python from the ground up. Each program corresponds to a concept or group of concepts I’ve learned—starting from the very basics like variables and loops, to more advanced topics like functions, file handling, and data analysis.

## 🎯 Purpose

- ✅ **Practice & Reinforce:** I write these mini-programs to solidify my understanding of Python.
- 📘 **Share & Teach:** Every program is structured to be beginner-friendly and is accompanied by a short explanation.
- 🌱 **Track Progress:** Each script represents a “session deliverable” as I work through my 1-year learning plan.
- 🤝 **Help Others:** If you're also learning Python, feel free to fork, clone, and use this repo as a guided reference.

## 🧩 What You'll Find

- Standalone `.py` files for each concept.
- Descriptive filenames and comments inside the code.
- A concept summary in each folder or file.
- No frameworks or dependencies—just pure Python basics!

> Whether you're a beginner or revisiting Python after a break, I hope this repo helps you on your journey too.

Happy Coding! ✨

## 📘 Program: Terminal-Based Calculator

This is a beginner Python program that runs in the terminal and performs six basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, and `//`.

### 🎯 Concepts Covered
- User Input and Output
- Variables and Data Types
- Conditional Logic
- Arithmetic Operators
- Basic Error Handling (e.g., division by zero)
- f-strings for formatting

### 📚 Reference
This was built after following the **Programming with Mosh** YouTube tutorial on Python basics. 
Having prior experience with programming made the transition to Python quite smooth.

### 🧠 Goal
This is part of my effort to catalog small, concept-focused Python programs as session deliverables that others can use to follow along or practice.
