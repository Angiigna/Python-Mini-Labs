# 🐍 Python Mini Labs – My Learning Journey

Welcome! This repository is a personal catalog of mini Python programs that document my learning process as I study Python from the ground up. Each program corresponds to a concept or group of concepts I’ve learned—starting from the very basics like variables and loops, to more advanced topics like functions, file handling, and data analysis.

## 🎯 Purpose

- ✅ **Practice & Reinforce:** I write these mini-programs to solidify my understanding of Python.
- 📘 **Share & Teach:** Every program is structured to be beginner-friendly and is accompanied by a short explanation.
- 🌱 **Track Progress:** Each script represents a “session deliverable” as I work through my 1-year learning plan.
- 🤝 **Help Others:** If you're also learning Python, feel free to fork, clone, and use this repo as a guided reference.

## 🧩 What You'll Find

- Standalone `.py` files for each concept.
- Descriptive filenames and comments inside the code.
- A concept summary in each folder or file.
- No frameworks or dependencies—just pure Python basics!

> Whether you're a beginner or revisiting Python after a break, I hope this repo helps you on your journey too.

Happy Coding! ✨

### 🔢 Program 1: Terminal-Based Calculator

**📝 Description:**  
A simple calculator that runs in the terminal and performs basic arithmetic operations:  
Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), Division (`/`), Exponentiation (`**`), and Floor Division (`//`).  
The user inputs two numbers and an operator, and the result is displayed.

**📌 Concepts Covered:**
- Input/Output
- Variables & Data Types
- Arithmetic Operators
- Conditional Statements (`if-elif-else`)
- Basic Error Handling (e.g., division by zero)
- String Formatting using `f-strings`

**📚 Reference:**  
Learned from the [Programming with Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/@programmingwithmosh) Python Basics tutorial.  
Prior experience with C, C++, and JavaScript helped in picking up Python quickly.

### 🧪 Program 2: FizzBuzz

**📝 Description:**  
This classic beginner-level program prints numbers from `1` to a user-defined limit. Based on divisibility:
- Prints `"Fizz"` if divisible by 3
- Prints `"Buzz"` if divisible by 5
- Prints `"FizzBuzz"` if divisible by both 3 and 5
- Otherwise, prints the number itself

**📌 Concepts Covered:**
- Input/Output
- Loops (`for`, `range`)
- Conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Modulo Operator (`%`)
- Functions
- Logic Building

**📚 Reference:**  
Learned from the [Programming with Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/@programmingwithmosh) Python Basics tutorial.

🧪 Program 3: Number Guessing Game  
📝 Description:  
This is an interactive terminal-based number guessing game with three difficulty levels:  

- **Easy**: Guess a number between 1 and 10 (5 attempts)  
- **Medium**: Guess a number between 1 and 50 (10 attempts)  
- **Hard**: Guess a number between 1 and 100 (15 attempts)  

The program randomly generates a number and gives the player hints ("too low" or "too high") after each guess. The game supports replaying and ends gracefully when the user chooses to quit.

📌 Concepts Covered:  
- Input/Output  
- Loops (`for`, `while`)  
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)  
- Random Number Generation (`random.randint()`)  
- Functions and Code Structuring  
- Basic Game Logic  

📚 Reference:  
Learned from the Programming with Mosh Python Basics tutorial.

### 🎯 Goal

These mini programs are part of a structured, hands-on approach to learning Python. Each script is designed to reinforce specific topics while providing practical examples. The aim is to create a useful reference for myself and other beginners who want to follow a topic-wise, project-backed learning path.
