"""
ðŸŽ¯ Number Guessing Game

This Python program is an interactive number guessing game played via the terminal.
The user can select from three difficulty levels â€” Easy, Medium, and Hard â€” each
with a different range of numbers and allowed number of attempts.

Gameplay:
- The program randomly selects a number within the chosen difficulty range.
- The user has a limited number of attempts to guess the number correctly.
- After each guess, the program provides hints whether the guess is too high or too low.
- If the user guesses the number correctly, they win.
- If they use up all attempts without guessing, the correct number is revealed."""
